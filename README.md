## What I did and How I did It.

Oh boy, this project was very tricky. Juggling multiple functions and trying to make sure that everything worked correctly was stressful and challenging. The hardest part was figuring out all the variables I needed from the HTML, and figuring out what those functions had to do and how many I needed to get this thing to "function". The main thing I did was look at multiple examples of quiz codes on the internet, but that barely helped, considering every person had a different way of producing a similar product, and all said code looked very different. The amount of creativity and individualism was actually overwhelming and made it difficult to understand what each line of code meant. I eventually settled on 1 and used it as a basis to get a skeleton together. After which, I got the JSON.array and the local storage to work properly, and display the results on the screen. After that, did a smidge of CSS, and added some extra funtions to help make things happen a bit smoother.
